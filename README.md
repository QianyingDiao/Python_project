You are given a dataset that contains the geo-codes for where customers shop and where customers live. Create an interactive map that accomplishes the following: when a user clicks a shop, the customers who shop there are highlighted, lines are drawn from all the customers to that shop, or some such visual that helps the user to visualize where a storeâ€™s customers come from

Please do not move the python notebook out of this folder before running the code. The python notebook will create html files that will be saved to this folder and can be accessed through the link in the notebook and interactively by clicking on the different stores on the html maps.
